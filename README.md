# Data Structures and Algorithms with C/C++

## <span style="color:brown;"> Announcements - Update Dec 23, 2023</span>

- <span style="color:green;">**To all groups (01, 04, 06, 07, 08, and 09).**</span>
  
   - You have two projects to submit: **Mastermind** and **Longest Word**.

   - Do not send the source code via email. Instead, the procedure is as follows:
      - Create a GitHub account.
      - Create a repository for each project.
      - Then, using git commands (`git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, etc.), push the source to the created repo.

   - **Deadline:** You still have time to work on both projects. The validation of these two projects will be in person **after the final exams**.

  - The topics of the first and second projects can be found here:
    - [Mastermind](6.%20final%20projects/mastermind/). 
  
    - Longest Word: [Part 1](6.%20final_projects/longest%20word/part%201/) and [Part 2](6.%20final%20projects/longest%20word/part%202/). 

    Please read and understand carefully the topic of each project before starting the implementation. If you have questions or concerns, do not hesitate to contact me at <[amine.merzoug@univ-batna2.dz](mailto:amine.merzoug@univ-batna2.dz)>
