# Data Structures and Algorithms with C/C++

## <span style="color:brown;"> Announcements - Update Jan 29, 2024</span>

- <span style="color:green;">**To all groups.**</span>

  **1/ Project Submission**
 
  - Projects sent via email will not be taken into consideration. Instead:
      1) Create a GitHub account.
      2) Create a repository for each project.
      3) Then, using git commands, push the source to the created repos.

  **2/ Project Validation**

   **Date:** Tuesday January 30 2024

   **Location:** A1

  **The validation of the projects is not mandatory**. 
  
   - The mark of your practical work has already been calculated as follows:
  
      [12 (written test) + 8 pts (presence)] / 20.

   - However: 
      - If you'd like to discuss your work and get feedback, feel free to come to the validation even if you obtained 20/20 as a practical work mark. 
      - Bring a laptop with you and make sure that everything is working properly (Code, Git, Github, etc.)
      - No need to show up and waste your time, if you copied the code from someone or somewhere.
